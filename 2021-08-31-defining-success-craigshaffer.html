<h4> What would success look like for you by the end of this class </h4>
<p> Going into this semester, I have taken two computer science courses through Grand View and a simple Principles of Computer Science course in high school. Despite my lack of coursework in the subject, I have practiced building my own projects away from school as a way of improving my skills. Not knowing any of the development processes or correct paths to take, I have been able to recreate simple games like Snake as well as a few larger projects that I hope to go back and improve. </p>
<p> My main goal for this class is to learn more about developing software from start to finish and how to maintain/improve it. By the end of this course, I’d like to be able to make my own small projects and improve on ones that I have started. For example, last year I started working on a fantasy football analytics tool. Right now the functions are basic and can plot player data to compare with the rest of the league. Hopefully, by the end of the semester, I’ll be able to add new features and streamline the development process for these projects. </p>
<p> Another goal I have is to become more confident. I want to have confidence in my abilities and confidence in working in teams. I think working with others will be a huge skill to have when I reach the job market. Practicing programming and communicating with a team will allow me to be more proficient in those areas. By improving, I feel that I will be more confident in myself and my abilities. </p>
<p> Comparing these two main goals with my classmates, there is a lot of overlap. Nearly everyone in the class wants to learn the development process for software for the first time or to learn something new about the development process. Another common theme was confidence in general. Whether it be in a team setting or just in their own abilities, it got brought up several times in the class discussion. Improving in these areas seems to be the main thing the class wants to accomplish in CPSC 363. </p>
<p> Outside of these two, I think that time management and not getting stressed are definitely goals I should look to work towards. Being able to properly time out my tasks and projects will benefit me in the present, as well as later in life. Being able to keep a schedule and time things out will also keep me less stressed. If I know how long things should take I can better plan my work and get more done. The more I can get done the less I have to stress about. I think that these goals should be worked on in every class and not just this one. </p>
<p> Overall, I think that I just want to come out of this course with a better understanding of software development and improve my confidence. I think these are two important areas for my future career in the software-dominated world. If I come out of the semester with these two things, I would consider the semester a major success and be happy with the outcome. </p>
