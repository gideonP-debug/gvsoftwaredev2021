<h4> The Assignment: </h4>
<p>Imagine repeating the past month of software development for 8hrs/day and 5days/wk and 50 weeks/year for the next year</p>
</section>
<h4> My thoughts: </h4>
        <p>What I like:<p>
        <ul>
            <li>Freedom to choose how to solve a task/problem</li>
            <li>Challenged to learn new skills to complete each task - becoming a better overall programmer</li>
            <li>Improving communication through various means (zoom, email, in person, team setting, etc)</li>
            <li>Work can be done remotely</li>
            <li>You get to build something and see the end result</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What I dislike:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes need more instruction on what/how to do something</li>
            <li>Different experience levels slow group projects down</li>
            <li>Technical difficulties can derail a task</li>
        </ul>

<h4> Overall Thoughts: </h4>
        <p>Overall, I could see myself enjoying this as a potential career. I like that Iâ€™m being challenged to learn new things and become an overall better programmer through our assignments. I think seeing a project progress from start to finish is motivating and exciting. I think eventually there could be some burnout from the process, but right now it is new and refreshing. </p>
