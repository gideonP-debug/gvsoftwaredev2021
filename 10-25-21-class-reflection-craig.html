<h4> Class Reflection: </h4>
    <p>At the start of the semester, I just wanted to be more comfortable with my programming ability and to learn more about the software development process. I would say that at this point in the semester I have progressed pretty quickly towards these goals. I now feel very confident in my abilities and understanding of the development cycle. Overall, I would say that this semester has been successful in terms of achieving my initial goals.<p>
    <p>As for the class itself, I think it's gone well. I enjoy the work that we've done and the collaboration that has resulted because of these assignments. I think the website is coming along nicely and I think that as a class we are progressively becoming better programmers because of this work. Since I think it has gone well, I don't think I would change anything.</p>

<h4> Back-End Development: </h4>
    <p>Back-end development is what is going on behind the scenes of an application. Back-end developers build, maintain, and debug the back end that runs an application. The back-end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. If you want to be a back-end developer, a good understanding of databases, server programming languages and architecture is a must.</p>
    <p>Back-end developers also have to be able to collaborate with others. They have to work with front-end developers to translate their functions to content in the appâ€™s user interface. In addition to working with front-end developers, They must also work well with product managers, project managers, architects, user experience designers and researchers, security developers, and many more to bring web applications to life.</p>
    <p>Skills needed to be successful in Back-end Development:</p>
    <details>

<h4> Scrum: </h4>
    <p>Scrum is a structured agile approach. With scrum, a team promises to deliver some increment of work by the end of each set time interval. These short time intervals (usually two to four weeks) are known as sprints. The short time frame of a sprint forces complex tasks to be split into smaller stories and help your team learn and accomplish these tasks quickly. These sprints also contain regular meetings with your team to update each other on the progress that has been made.</p>
    <p>Scrum teams have three defined roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Product Owner - advocates for the customer, manages the product backlog, and helps prioritize the work done by the development team.</li>
            <li>The Scrum Master - helps the team stay grounded in the scrum principles.</li>
            <li>The Development Team - chooses the work to be done, delivers increments, and demonstrates collective accountability.</li>
        </ul>

<h4> Thoughts on David's Experience: </h4>
<p>I think that David's experiences and work that he shared in class helped put the work we are doing into perspective. His description of the team he works in allowed me to picture what working in software development would look like and the overall scrum process. His experiences also made me reflect on how the work we've done in the class is similar even if the tasks have been very different. For example, our class has broken down into groups focusing on different tasks to complete our website. In a way, we are functioning somewhat like a scrum team by dividing and conquering small tasks over short time periods. Overall, David's experiences really put the work we've done into perspective and gave us a glimpse into how the skills we've learned are applied in the workplace.</p>
