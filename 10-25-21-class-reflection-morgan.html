                    <h4> Class reflection: </h4>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> I feel as if I have gained a basic understanding of Software Development and I love all the hands on experience we have gotten. Doing class on zoom is nice so we can share our screens and communicate easier. However, sometimes it's hard for me because I learn best in a classroom with face to face instruction.  </li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4> Data Science: </h4>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> Data Scientists ask questions, analyze code, integrate and store data, create models, measure and imporve results, present results, etc. Data Scientists have many rolls they take on, most of the time though, a Data Scientist would say they spend a majorty of their time just cleaning the data.</li> 
                        </ul>
                    <h4> Waterfall: </h4>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> Waterfall project management is a tactic that divides the software development life cycle into phases. You can only move to the next phase once the previous one has been completed. This method only occurs once, so each phase is only completed once. Information is gathered as much as possible at the start of a project because any changes after it has started requires you to restart! A couple benefits of using the Waterfall method are that it has straightforward planning and defined team roles. A couple of disadvantages are it's not flexible to uncertainty and testing is only done in later phases of the project.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4> Thoughts on David's work:</h4>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> I don't have any questions but I really enjoyed just being able to see his weekly schedule and walking through his software. As someone looking for an internship, I get really nervous about the software that will be used and understanding all the elements that go into completing my work. I have never used COBOL before but seeing it and just listening to a few of the rules he shared was insightful. </li>
