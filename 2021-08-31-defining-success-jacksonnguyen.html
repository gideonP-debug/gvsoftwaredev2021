				<h4> Description of the code</h4>

				<p>Video link example</p>

				<ul>
    <li>
        The code contains the two classes tmp and student.
    </li> 
    <li>The list of the student and the goals of the student are stored in the string array in the main method of the tmp class</li>
    <li>The user is prompted to enter the name of the student and the goal of the student is displayed.</li>
    <li> In the end, the user is prompted to enter the week number then the date is printed as the week number.
     </li>
<p> <em>The string array is used to keep the goals of the class and the list of the students. In case, the user enters the student that is not in the class or list then a message is displayed on the screen that the student doesn't exist.</em></p>
<p> First, the util and math library is imported in the Tmp.java.The following are the goals of the class that are assumed here: play the game,Watch the movie, sleep completely, complete for the class at the end of the semester. The string array is used to keep the goals of the class and the list of the students. In case, the user enters the student that is not in the class or list then a message is displayed on the screen that the student doesn't exist.
