				<h4>Class Reflection:</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>In my initial goals for Software Development class this semester, I highlighted that I wanted to gain a broad understanding of software development, learn how to implement code in the real-world, and learn how it can be applied in the field of data analytics. In addition, I wanted to improve upon soft skills such as communication and working as a member of the team. Just after the mid-way point of the semester, I am proud of the progress that I have made in each of these areas. I feel particular improvement in my ability to implement/collaborate on code in the real-world and work as a member of a team. We have done these extensively, and I feel great improvement in these areas.</li>
					<li>I think that this course is going well for me. I enjoy our class discussions and collaborating on the projects as a team, and have learned a lot since the beginning of the course in August. I am looking forward to continuing this and having a chance the organize class assignments for a week.</li>

				<h4>Cloud Computing:</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>Cloud computing involves using networks of remote servers to store and manage data, as opposed to using a personal computer or local server for storage.</li>
					<li>Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies rent access to anything from a cloud service provider. This allows companies to avoid upfront costs of owning and maintaining their own data infrastructure. </li>
					<li>Some examples of cloud computing in our everyday lives: the cloud back-up of photos on your phone, cloud storage for emails, video streaming for applications such as Hulu or Netflix.</li>
					<li>The cloud computing method of delivering a service over the internet is becoming preferred as opposed to offering standalone products.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Scrum: </h4>
			
					<ul>
					<li>Scrum is an agile framework, used most frequently by software development teams, that helps groups work together, and structure and manage their work load. </li>
					<li>The scrum framework is based on continuous learning - the work team does not know everything at the beginning of the project, but their knowledge will evolve with time and experience with the project. To be consistent and successful, it is important to have strong communication, transparency, and a dedication to continuous improvement. Scrum uses visual methods to track work progress, placing an emphasis on efficiency and splitting complex tasks into smaller, more manageable, pieces of work (called sprints).</li>
					<li>Scrum Artifacts:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Product Backlog - maintained by the product owner, it is a dynamic master "To-Do" list for the team</li>
						<li>Sprint Backlog - the list of items selected by the development team during the implementation of the current sprint cycle</li>
						<li>Increment - the usable end product from a sprint session, what is reached when the project or sprint is completed</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Essential Scrum Roles: </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Product Owner - in charge of understanding the business, the customers, and the market requirements in orer to prioritize work order for the team</li>
						<li>Master - act as coaches for the product owner, team members, and the business to fine-tune the scrum processes of the group</li>
						<li>Development Team - drives the plan for each sprint, working as a team to maintain organization and ensure a successful sprint completion.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<h4>Thoughts on David's work:</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>I think the level of team-work and collaboration involved in software development was really displayed by David's presentation. He showed how the team functions and the tools that they use to maintain strong communication for the development of their products.</li>
					<li>It is fascinating how one product team is made-up of people from so many different areas of expertise.</li>
					<li>How do software development teams collaborate with data anaytics teams within your company?</li>
				</ul>
