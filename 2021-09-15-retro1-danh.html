			<h4>Thoughts about software development job after class activities</h4>
			<p>
			We have had 2 different coding products for each individual, a calibration exercise and an HTML group project. Each product had its own features to pay attention to and reflect on for experience. The calibration exercise was to re-evaluate ourselves as a software developer with independent skills for development. The group project went further and got us to collaborate with a teammate to fulfill the goals.
			</p>

			<p>
			After the developments, I found that I did well with some parts along the progress. First, I managed to finish the code for the individual project early, and that helped gain more time for debugging and testing. Second, I found and managed to use a platform that is be accessible easily by everybody. This is beneficial in the whole. Third, I stepped up and did what was necessary when the development needed. Last, I got along well with my teammate in the process.
			</p>

			<p>
			However, I still have something to improve for a better preparation for a full-time development role. First, I need to collaborate more closely with my teammate to fix issues that arise earlier. Second, the accessible platform that I used cannot be used by other to create content easily, so that created difficulty and discouraged the effort to gather on this same platform. A choice for development process needs to be tested as well as the development product. Last but not least, I should have tested othersâ€™ code earlier, so they have more time to review and revise their solution.
